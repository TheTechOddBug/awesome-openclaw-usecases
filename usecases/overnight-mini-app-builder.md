# Overnight mini-App Builder

Inspired by [Alex Finn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTCi_q6iuCM&t=414s). Explicitly tell your open code to be proactive and explain your goals, interests, plans, or strategies so it has a better understanding of what you want to achieve. 

Then ask it to build you overnight, a mini app idea that gets you closer to your goals. It could be a new SaaS idea for launching in the future, or something that automates a boring part of your life. And explicitly tell it to build the app as an MVP and not to overcomplicate it.

You will wake up every morning with a new surprise.
